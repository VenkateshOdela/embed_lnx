   		-	compile time polymorphism
   				- function overloading
   				- operator overloading
   			
   		-	runtime polymorphism
   				- virtual functions
   				
   				
   				
   
   Compile-Time Polymorphism Vs. Run-Time Polymorphism :
   
	Compile Time Polymorphism										Run-Time Polymorphism
	
At Compile time, which functions to be called is decided.		At Runtime, which function to be called is decided.

Also known as early or static binding							Also known as late or dynamic binding

It executes faster because the function is resolved at 
compilation time only.	                                       It executes slower because the function is resolved at Run-time.

It is achieved through function and operator overloading	   It is achieved through function overriding and virtual functions
