Function overloading VS Function overriding :

-	Function overloading is used when we want multiple functions providing a similar implementation.
-	Function Overloading happens in the same class when we declare same functions with different arguments in the same class.
-	Overloading happens at the compile time thats why it is also known as 'compile time polymorphism'.
-	Function overloading we can have any number of overloaded functions.


-	Function overriding is used when we want to add some additional functionality on top of base class implementation.
-	Function Overriding is happens in the child class when child class overrides parent class function.
-	Function overriding happens at run time which is why it is known as 'run time polymorphism'.
-	Function overriding we can have only one overriding function in the child class.
