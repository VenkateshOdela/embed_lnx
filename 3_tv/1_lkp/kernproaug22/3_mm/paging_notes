    -	The process of retrieving processes in the form of pages from the secondary storage into the main memory is known as paging.
    
    -	Paging is a storage mechanism that allows OS to retrieve processes from the secondary storage into the main memory in the form of pages.
    
    -	Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory.
    
    PAGE FAULT:
    
    -	A page fault occurs when a process tries to access a page of memory that is not currently in physical memory.
    
    -	When a page fault occurs, the Linux kernel retrieves the missing page from secondary storage and maps it to a physical address in memory.
    
    -	A page fault is an event that occurs when a program requests data from a page in memory that is not currently in physical memory. 
    	When this happens, the operating system must retrieve the data from secondary storage (such as a hard disk) and 
    	load it into physical memory. This process is called "page fault handling."
    
    DEMAND PAGING:
    
    -	Demand paging is a technique used by operating systems to optimize memory usage by only loading pages into physical memory 
    	when they are actually needed.
    	
    -	With demand paging, the operating system initially loads only a small portion of a program 
    	into physical memory and then loads additional pages as they are accessed. 
    	
    -	This allows the operating system to keep more programs running simultaneously, as it only loads the pages that are actually 
    	needed at any given time.
