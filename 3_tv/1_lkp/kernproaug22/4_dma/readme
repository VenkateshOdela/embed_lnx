What Does Direct Memory Access (DMA) Mean?
-	Direct memory access (DMA) is a method that allows an input/output (I/O) device 
    to send or receive data directly to or from the main memory(RAM), bypassing the CPU to 
  	speed up memory operations.

-	The process is managed by a chip known as a DMA controller (DMAC).


DMA
 -- dma is capability of device to access the physical RAM
 
 
 -- | CPU Core |<-->|Memory Controller|<-->|Device| (device example :PCIe USB)
                            |
                            |
                         |Memory|    
                         
 -- with additional device DMA engine , the devices are capable of using memory;
 -- DMA ENGINE circuit , DMA transfer
 -- CPU is in IDLE when DMA Transfer in progress
 -- DMA is in IDLE when  CPU operations is in progress.(DMA request and Ackno
 
 -- when cpu in idle - when cpu perform other operations also require access to memory
 --
 -- DMA Request for system bus if cpu acknowledge then , DMA is now read to access the memory, otherwise no access to RAM
 
 -- DMA by itself is not a bus, it is circuit;
 
    -- writing driver to device(n/w controller).
    -- DMA Transfer data(packet) to device(n/w controller)
       --steps:
         --cpu core
           -- allocate apropriate memory
           -- caching 
           -- populate data into memory
           -- configure dma
           
     -- cache coherent interconnect
     
     -- DMA Address = Bus Addres
     
     -- a device dma driver involved
         - how many cache that cpu have
         - is hw cache is chorent support.
         - is iommu present or not
         
          - then which api to use?
          
          
   -- system memory  - io MMU   - DMA controller
     
      --if DMA supports 32 bit address, how many address io MMU SHOULD ABLE TO TRANSLATE 4GB;
