1.system V message queues : 

  #include <sys/msg.h>

  msgget()  :  create a system V message queue

  msgsnd() :  Send a message

  msgrcv() :  Receive a message



2.posix message Queues :

  #include <mqueue.h>

  mq_open() - open a posix message queue

  mq_send() - Send a message

  mq_recieve() - Receive a message
  
  mq_close()
  
  mq_unlink()

  mqd_t mq_open(const char *name, int oflag, mode_t mode,struct mq_attr *attr);
  
  
             struct mq_attr {
               long mq_flags;       /* Flags (ignored for mq_open()) */
               long mq_maxmsg;      /* Max. # of messages on queue */
               long mq_msgsize;     /* Max. message size (bytes) */
               long mq_curmsgs;     /* # of messages currently in queue
                                       (ignored for mq_open()) */
           };
           
      The fields of the struct mq_attr pointed to attr specify 
      -	the maximum number of messages  and
      -	the  maximum  size of messages that the queue will allow.
      
  int mq_send(mqd_t mqdes, const char *msg_ptr,size_t msg_len, unsigned int msg_prio);
  
     - When a message is sent to a message queue using the mq_send() function, the priority of the message is specified as an argument.
     - in mq_send we only set priority for message and place in queue; 
     
  ssize_t mq_receive(mqd_t mqdes, char *msg_ptr,size_t msg_len, unsigned int *msg_prio);
     - mq_recvieve will receive the highest prioriy message in queue, that priority number also collected in one of argument;
     
     
 ---------------------------------

in message queue where the highest priority message is kept? in head or tail? how messages are filled in message queue based on priority?

  -- In a POSIX message queue, the message with the highest priority is kept at the front of the queue, which is the head of the queue. 
     This means that when a message is retrieved from the queue using mq_receive(), the message with the highest priority is the first 
     one to be retrieved.
     
  -- When a message is sent to a message queue using mq_send(), the message is inserted into the queue based on its priority value. 
     Specifically, messages with a higher priority value are inserted closer to the front of the queue (i.e., at the head of the queue),
     while messages with a lower priority value are inserted closer to the end of the queue (i.e., at the tail of the queue).

 advnatages of messagequeues over pipes?
 
 Message prioritization: POSIX message queues support message prioritization, which means that higher-priority messages 
 can be processed before lower-priority messages. Named pipes do not have this feature and treat all data as equal.
 
 Concurrency: POSIX message queues can be used by multiple processes simultaneously, whereas named pipes are limited to 
 one reader and one writer at a time.
