IPC : Inter Process Communication;

-- ipc describes different ways of 'message passing' between different processes in OS.

-- communication b/w process.

-- Communication can be of two types âˆ’

   - Between related processes,(such as parent and child processes.)

   - Between unrelated processes, or two or more different processes.

-- ipc types :
   
   - Pipes
   	- un-named pipes
    - Named pipes(FIF0)
   - Message Queue
   - Shared Memory
   - sockets
   

   -pipes.
     - unamed pipes : comm b/w related process only.
     
          	NOte: The problem with pipes is that they are usable only between processes that have a common ancestor 
              (i.e., a parent-child relationship), but this was fixed with the introduction of named pipes or FIFOs.
     	- popen() pclose()
     	- read() write()
     
     - Named pipes(FIFO): comm b/w related and unrelated process also possible.
     
       - mkfifo()
       - read() write()
       
       -  Opening a FIFO for reading normally blocks until some other process opens the same FIFO  for  writing,
          and vice versa.
     


 
   -message queues (comm b/w related and unrelated process)
   
       - mqopen()
       - mqsend()
       - mqreceive()
       - mqclose()
       
       
       - messages in a queue.
           | msg1 | msg2 | msg3 |   --> message queue
       - attributes :
       
          - long mq_maxmsg; // maximum number of messges allowed on queue
          - long mq_msgsize; // max size of a messages in bytes.
       

   -shared memory.

   -sockets.

---What is a process? A process is a program in execution.

	-What is a program? A program is a file containing the information of a process and how to build it during run time. 
	-When you start execution of the program, it is loaded into RAM and starts executing.

-- stack : is LIFO

-- orphan , zombie , daemon :

  - Orphan Process : 
      - As indicated by the name, orphan implies parentless process.
      - Parent Process , Child Process
      - If the parent process terminates before the child process, then
        child process now is called Orphan Process.
