 Layers description :
 
	-	We consider bottom two layers of the OSI model as the driver and networking hardware that are supplied with the system.
	
	-	The network layer is handled by the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.
	
	-	The transport layers that we can choose from are TCP and UDP.
		-	it is possible for an application to bypass the transport layer and use IPv4 or IPv6 directly. 
			we call it a raw socket.
			
	-	The upper three layers(session,presentation,application) of the OSI model are combined into a single layer called the
		application.
			-	The sockets programming interfaces described in this book are interfaces from the
				upper three layers (the "application") into the transport layer.
				
 Why do sockets provide the interface from the upper three layers of the OSI model into the transport layer? 
 
	There are two reasons for this design, which we note on the right side of Figure 1.14. 
	First, the upper three layers handle all the details of the
	application (FTP, Telnet, or HTTP, for example) and know little about the
	communication details. 
	
	The lower four layers know little about the application, but
	handle all the communication details: sending data, waiting for acknowledgments,
	sequencing data that arrives out of order, calculating and verifying checksums, and
	so on. 
	
	The second reason is that the upper three layers often form what is called a
	user process while the lower four layers are normally provided as part of the
	operating system (OS) kernel. 
	
	Unix provides this separation between the user
	process and the kernel, as do many other contemporary operating systems.
	
	Therefore, the interface between layers 4 and 5 is the natural place to build the API.

 ICMP :
 -	For example, if a router receives a packet that it cannot forward due to a routing problem, 
 	it will send an ICMP error message back to the sender, indicating the problem and suggesting a resolution.
 	
 -	ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is a network protocol that is used to send error messages and 
 	operational information about network conditions between devices on an IP (Internet Protocol) network.
 	
 -	ICMP messages are typically generated by network devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls, 
 	and they are used to inform other devices about network conditions, connectivity issues, and other network-related events.
 	
 -	ICMP is used in a variety of network applications, including diagnostic tools like ping and traceroute. 
 
 -	Ping uses ICMP echo requests and replies to test the connectivity between two devices.
 	-	ping command would use ICMP to send echo requests and receive echo replies. 
 		If the ping command received no reply, or received an ICMP error message indicating a problem with the network, 
 		you could use that information to identify the issue and take steps to resolve it.
 
 -	Traceroute uses ICMP time exceeded messages to identify the routers along a path to a destination device.

 how ping works?
 
 When you use the ping command to test the connectivity between two devices, 
 the command uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) to send echo requests and receive echo replies.

Here's how the process works:

When you enter the ping command and specify a target device, your device (the sender) creates an ICMP echo request message and 
sends it to the target device (the receiver).

The target device receives the ICMP echo request and generates an ICMP echo reply message. 
This message contains the same data as the original echo request, allowing the sender to verify that the data was transmitted correctly.

The target device sends the ICMP echo reply back to the sender, which receives the reply and 
calculates the round-trip time for the transmission 
(i.e., the time it took for the echo request to be sent, received by the target device, and the echo reply to be sent back).

The ping command then displays the round-trip time and other information about the transmission, 
such as the number of packets transmitted and received, and any packet loss that occurred during the transmission.

If the ping command does not receive an ICMP echo reply within a specified time (typically several seconds), 
it assumes that the transmission has failed and displays an error message indicating that the target device is not responding.

Overall, the ICMP echo request and reply messages used in the ping command provide a simple and 
effective way to test network connectivity and diagnose network issues.
