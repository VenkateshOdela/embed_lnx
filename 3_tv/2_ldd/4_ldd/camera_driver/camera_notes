Camera Processing Pipeline :

	-	The camera processing pipeline is a sequence of processing steps that convert the raw data 
		captured by the camera sensor into a usable image or video.
		
	-	The camera processing pipeline consists of below stages, 
		-	sensor data processing, 
		-	image signal processing, 
		-	compression, and 
		-	storage.
 
    - Sensor Data Processing:
     
      -	The first stage of the pipeline involves processing the raw data captured by the camera sensor. 
        The data is often in the form of a Bayer pattern, which is a grid of red, green, and blue color filters. 
        The sensor data processing stage performs operations such as white balance, color correction, and 
        demosaicing to convert the raw data into a usable format.
        
      - Bayer pattern is a color filter array that is commonly used in digital camera sensors. 
        The Bayer pattern consists of a grid of pixels with alternating red, green, and blue color filters arranged 
        in a specific pattern.
        
      - Each pixel in the Bayer pattern can only capture information about one color, either red, green, or blue. 
        The other two colors are interpolated using neighboring pixels that have color information for those colors. 
        This process is called demosaicing, and it's a crucial step in the camera processing pipeline.
        
      - Overall, demosaicing is a crucial step in the camera processing pipeline as it allows us to recover 
        missing color information and produce a high-quality, full-color image from a Bayer pattern image.
        
      - For example, in a region of an image where there are mainly red pixels, 
        the demosaicing algorithm can use neighboring red pixels to estimate the missing green and blue values. 
        Similarly, in a region where there are mainly blue pixels, 
        the algorithm can use neighboring blue pixels to estimate the missing red and green values.
     
     - Image signal processing:
     
      - The next stage of the pipeline involves processing the image data to improve its quality. 
        This includes operations such as noise reduction, sharpening, and contrast adjustment. 
        Image signal processing is also where features like autofocus and image stabilization are implemented.
        
     - Compression: 
     
      - Once the image data has been processed, it may need to be compressed to save storage space. 
        There are several compression algorithms that can be used, such as JPEG and HEVC.
        - JPEG : (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a widely used image compression standard. 
        - HEVC : (High Efficiency Video Coding) is a compression standard that is used for compressing video content.
        
     - Storage:
      
      - The final stage of the pipeline involves storing the processed and compressed image data. 
        This can be done on the camera itself or transferred to an external storage device.

 Video has long been inherent in embedded systems. Given that Linux is the favorite
kernel used in such systems, it goes without saying that it natively embeds its support
for video. This is the so-called V4L2, which stands for Video 4 (for) Linux 2

Through this framework, the Linux kernel is able to deal with camera devices and the bridge to
which they are connected, as well as the associated DMA engines.

Cameras can be connected to a computer or other device using a variety of interfaces, including:

USB (Universal Serial Bus): USB is a common interface used for connecting webcams, digital cameras, and other types of cameras to computers. 
It is a widely available standard interface that is supported by most operating systems.

Ethernet: Some cameras can be connected to a network using Ethernet, which allows them to be accessed remotely over the network.

HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface): HDMI is a high-speed interface used for transmitting audio and video signals between devices. 
Some cameras support HDMI output, allowing them to be connected directly to a monitor or TV.

SDI (Serial Digital Interface): SDI is a professional video interface used in broadcast and other high-end video applications. 
Some high-end cameras support SDI output.

MIPI (Mobile Industry Processor Interface): MIPI is a standard interface used in mobile devices and other small form factor devices. 
Some cameras use MIPI interfaces for high-speed data transfer and power management.

The specific interface used to connect a camera depends on the type of camera and the device it is being connected to.
