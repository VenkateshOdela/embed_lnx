--Linear data structure:Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, 
                        where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements. 
               
    --Static data structure: Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. 
      --example : array.

    --Dynamic data structure: In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during 
      the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. 
      --Examples : linked list, stack , queue.

--Non-linear data structure: Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly; 
                             'In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only'. <-----
  --Examples : Trees and Graphs.
