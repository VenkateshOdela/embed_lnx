/*
In this example, the buffer is implemented using a linked list of node structures.
Each node contains a data field to store a single character and a next field to point to the next node in the list.
The head and tail pointers keep track of the first and last nodes in the linked list, respectively.
The count variable keeps track of the number of characters in the buffer.

The write_to_buffer function creates a new node, fills in its data field with the character to be written, and adds it to the end of the linked list.
If the number of nodes in the linked list exceeds the maximum size of the buffer (BUFFER_SIZE), the oldest node is removed from the front of the list.

The read_from_buffer function removes the first node from the linked list and returns its data field.

In the main function, some data is written to the buffer and then read from the buffer and printed to the console.
 The code demonstrates how a linked list can be used to implement a circular buffer for storing incoming data.*/
