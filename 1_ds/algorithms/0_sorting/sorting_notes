1.Selection Sort :
  - Selection sort finds the smallest element in the array and 
  - place it on the first place on the list, 
  - then it finds the second smallest element in the array and place it on the second place. 
  - This process continues until all the elements are moved to their correct ordering. 
    It carries running time O(n2) which is worst than insertion sort.
    
2.bubble sort :
  - It is the simplest sort method which performs sorting by repeatedly moving the largest element to the highest index of the array. 
    It comprises of comparing each element to its adjacent element and replace them accordingly.
    
 3.insertion sort :
  - As the name suggests, insertion sort inserts each element of the array to its proper place. 
    It is a very simple sort method which is used to arrange the deck of cards while playing bridge.
